#+TITLE: My dot files


This project is meant for me to be able to find my tooling on any machine I setup.

I use stow for handling symlinks.

* Installation

~git clone~ this repository in your $HOME folder. This is needed for stow to work properly.
Then run the install script.

* Emacs stuff

** Magit

For having all the options in rebase (for example --exec), you need to set the proper transient level. See ~transient-set-level~ in [[https://magit.vc/manual/transient.html][the transient documentation.]]
