#+TITLE: My dot files


This project is meant for me to be able to find my tooling on any machine I setup.

I use stow for handling symlinks.

* Installation

~git clone~ this repository in your $HOME folder. This is needed for stow to work properly.
Then run the install script.

* Emacs stuff

** GPG / Secrets
To handle secrets and so on with GPG and Emacs, you need to create a ~secrets.el~ file in your home folder. It should have the following format:

#+begin_src lisp
; -*- epa-file-encrypt-to: ("alexvanacker@gmail.com") -*-

(setq some_secret "some secret value")
#+end_src

** Magit

For having all the options in rebase (for example --exec), you need to set the proper transient level. See ~transient-set-level~ in [[https://magit.vc/manual/transient.html][the transient documentation.]]
